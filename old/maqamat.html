              What is a Maqam ?</b></font> 
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                Arabic music, a <a href="">maqam</a> (plural <b>maqamat</b>) is 
                a set of notes with traditions that define relationships between 
                them, habitual patterns, and their melodic development. Maqamat 
                are best defined and understood in the context of the rich Arabic 
                music repertoire. The nearest equivalent in Western classical 
                music would be a mode (e.g. Major, Minor, etc.)</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                Arabic scales which maqamat are built from are not even-tempered, 
                unlike the chromatic scale used in Western classical music. Instead, 
                5th notes are tuned based on the 3rd harmonic. The tuning of the 
                remaining notes entirely depends on the maqam. The reasons for 
                this tuning are probably historically based on string instruments 
                like the oud. A side effect of not having even-tempered tuning 
                is that the same note (by name) may have a slightly different 
                pitch depending on which maqam it is played in.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What 
                are Quarter Tones ?</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many 
                maqamat include notes that can be approximated with quarter tones 
                (depicted using the half-flat sign <img src="images/symbols/half_flat.gif" width="9" height="12"> 
                or the half-sharp sign <img src="images/symbols/half_sharp.gif" width="5" height="12">), 
                although they rarely are precise quarters falling exactly halfway 
                between two semitones. Even notes depicted as semitones sometimes 
                include microtonal subtleties depending on the maqam in which 
                they are used. For this reason, when writing Arabic music using 
                the Western notation system, there is an understanding that the 
                exact tuning of each note might vary with each maqam and must 
                be learned by ear.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
                peculiarity of maqamat is that the same note is not always played 
                with the same exact pitch. The pitch may vary slightly, depending 
                on the melodic flow and what other notes are played before and 
                after that note. The idea behind this effect is to round sharp 
                corners in the melody by drawing the furthest notes nearer. This 
                effect is sometimes called the law of attraction or gravity, and 
                is common in other musical traditions (e.g. in Byzantine music).</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Are 
                maqamat transposable ?</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                Arabic maqamat are taught and documented, each maqam is usually 
                associated with the same starting note (tonic). For example, maqam 
                <a href="maqamat/bayati.html#bayati">Bayati</a> is almost always 
                shown as starting on D in reference textbooks.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                general maqamat are transposable, but only to a handful of other 
                tonics. For example, maqam <a href="maqamat/bayati.html#bayati">Bayati</a> 
                usually starts on D, but it can also start on G and A. When transposing 
                Arabic maqamat, musicians mention the tonic name after the maqam 
                name for clarity (e.g. &quot;Bayati on G&quot; or &quot;Bayati 
                on A&quot;). </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
                this reason also, only a few quarter tones are exploited (with 
                the understanding that the term quarter tone is approximate, and 
                that many semitones include microtonal variations). The most frequently 
                used quarter tones are: E<img src="images/symbols/half_flat.gif" width="9" height="12">, 
                A<img src="images/symbols/half_flat.gif" width="9" height="12"> 
                and B<img src="images/symbols/half_flat.gif" width="9" height="12">.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                is unlike scales in Western classical music, where for example 
                each scale can have 11 possible tonics. Total freedom to transpose 
                requires playing Western music on even-tempered instruments (e.g. 
                the piano) where all semitone intervals are exactly equal.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                reasons behind this limitation are probably technical and pragmatic, 
                and have to do with the difficulty of transposing freely on classical 
                Arabic instruments (oud, nay, qanun). On the oud for example, 
                it is important to be able to exploit open strings to play tonics, 
                4th and 5th notes, since the sound on open strings is always in 
                tune and louder. In addition, since the oud tuning is not even-tempered 
                but based on harmonic 4th and 5th intervals between open strings, 
                maqamat dont sound equally in tune and pleasant on every tonic.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
                maqamat change names when transposed because they vary in their 
                feel or mood. A maqam could also have a different melodic development 
                (sayr) when transposed, including a different dominant note, etc. 
                </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
                example</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                maqam <a href="maqamat/sikah.html#rahat-el-arwah">Rahat El Arwah</a> 
                is a transposed version of maqam <a href="maqamat/sikah.html#huzam">Huzam</a>, 
                but they have different moods. To describe the difference using 
                very subjective terminology, the first is lower, more mellow and 
                spiritual, the second is higher, lighter and funkier.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
                reason for different transposed versions of a maqam having different 
                names might be historic, since each name (and tonic) may have 
                been used in a different region (Arab, Persian, Turkish. etc.). 
                An example of this is the <a href="maqamat/hijaz-kar.html#hijaz-kar">Hijaz 
                Kar</a>, <a href="maqamat/hijaz-kar.html#shadd-araban">Shadd Araban</a>, 
                <a href="maqamat/hijaz-kar.html#shahnaz">Shahnaz</a>, and <a href="maqamat/hijaz-kar.html#suzidil">Suzidil</a> 
                maqamat, which all have the same tonal intervals. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
                on the subject of transposition, musicians often retune their 
                instruments a few semitones higher or lower than the absolute 
                reference (e.g. A = 440 Hz) rather than transpose a maqam, especially 
                in old 1920's and 1930's recordings. The reason for doing this 
                is that melodies sound much better when their tonics and 4th/5th 
                notes fall on open strings, because of the way string instruments 
                like the oud or violin resonate. This is not the case with voice, 
                for example.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How 
                can maqamat be broken down ?</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                building blocks for maqamat are sets of 3, 4 or 5 notes, called 
                trichords, tetrachords and pentachords, respectively. The Arabic 
                word for these sets is <i>jins</i> (plural <i>ajnas</i>). The 
                word <i>jins</i> means the gender, type or nature of something. 
                In general each maqam is made up two main ajnas (sets) called 
                lower and upper jins. These can be joined at the same note, at 
                two adjacent notes, or can overlap each other. A maqam may also 
                include other secondary ajnas which are very useful for <a href="modulation.html">modulation</a>. 
                Instead of thinking of a maqam as a collection of 8 or more individual 
                notes, it's often useful to think of it as a group of two or more 
                ajnas (sets).</font></p>

                there harmony in Arabic music ?</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arabic 
                music is mostly melodic, which means it rarely includes harmony 
                and chords. There are a few exceptions, read more in this excellent 
                article about <a href="http://www.saedmuhssin.com/harmony.html" target="_blank">Harmony 
                and Arabic Music</a>. The main reason why harmony is rarely used 
                is that chords dont sound very pleasant when they include quarter 
                tones or microtonal variations. Harmony sounds best when notes 
                have a natural harmonic relationship (3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th harmonic, 
                etc). In Arabic music, this is true for a tonic and its fifth 
                (3rd harmonic), but most of the time not true for any other note 
                combination.</font></p>

                is the difference between a maqam and a scale ?</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                Arabic maqam is built on top of the Arabic scale. The maqam is 
                generally made up of one octave (8 notes), although sometimes 
                the maqam scale extends up to 2 octaves. But the maqam is much 
                more than a scale:</font></p>

                  A maqam may include microtonal variations such that tones, half 
                  tones and quarter tones in its underlying scale are not precisely 
                  that. E.g. the E<img src="images/symbols/half_flat.gif" width="9" height="12"> 
                  in maqam <a href="maqamat/bayati.html">Bayati</a> is tuned slightly

                  in maqam <a href="maqamat/rast.html">Rast</a>. These variations 
                  must be learned by listening not by reading, which is why the 
                  oral tradition is the correct way to learn Arabic music.<br>

                  maqam has a different character which conveys a mood, in a similar 
                  fashion to the mood in a Major or Minor scale, although that 
                  mood is subjective. Since classical Arabic music is mostly melodic 
                  (excludes harmony), the choice of maqam greatly affects the 
                  mood of the piece.<br>

                  be emphasized, how often, and in what order. This means that

                <br>
                There is no absolute reference for the Arabic scale. In 1932, 
                the Arabic Music Conference in Cairo established that regional 
                variations existed in the intonation of Arabic maqamat. Within 
                each region, oral traditions continued and created de-facto standards, 
                although these standards converged to some extent with the advent 
                of recording and broadcasting.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                phenomenon that greatly influenced intonation in Arabic music 
                was the introduction of even-tempered instruments (some of which 
                were altered to produce quarter tones), mostly in the second half 
                of the 20th century. The accordion, electric guitar, electric 
                (fretted) bass, piano, guitar, electric piano, electric organ 
                and synthesizer were gradually introduced to the Arabic ensemble. 
                The main incentive behind this change was innovation, modernization, 
                and the desire to add harmony to Arabic music.</font></p>

                  intonation of the same quarter tone can vary with each maqam.

                  in maqam <a href="maqamat/rast.html#rast">Rast</a> has a higher

                  in maqam <a href="maqamat/bayati.html#bayati">Bayati</a>. Even 
                  tempered instruments eliminate these subtle variations, producing 
                  dry and rigid quarter tones.</font></div>

                  the Arabic maqam has regional variations that make up a lot 
                  of its color. For example, the E<img src="images/symbols/half_flat.gif" width="9" height="12"> 
                  in maqam <a href="maqamat/rast.html#rast">Rast</a> has a higher 
                  tuning in Aleppo than in Cairo. Even tempered instruments eliminate 
                  these regional variations, reducing the Arabic maqam to its 
                  lowest denominator.</font></div>

                  semitones in the Arabic scale often include microtonal variations. 
                  A prime example are the 2nd and 3rd notes in the <a href="ajnas.html#hijaz">Hijaz</a> 
                  tetrachord, which are played closer together so as to shrink 
                  the 1&frac12; tone interval. These variations cannot be performed 
                  on even-tempered instruments. In case of harmonic music, microtonal 
                  variations are even undesirable since they reduce harmony.</font></div>

              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
                time, the original tuning of maqam <a href="maqamat/hijaz.html#hijaz">Hijaz</a> 
                had been lost except in a handful of new recordings, and was replaced 
                with what is called &#147;piano <a href="maqamat/hijaz.html#hijaz">Hijaz</a>&#148; 
                (a derogatory term.) Equally bad is the &#147;piano <a href="maqamat/ajam.html#ajam">Ajam</a>&#148;, 
                where the 3rd note should be slightly lower and more mellow. Maqamat 
                like <a href="maqamat/ajam.html#jiharkah">Jiharkah</a> are rarely 
                played on even-tempered instruments, even on ones that have been 
                altered to produce quarter tones.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                conclusion, the new generation of Arabic musicians, singers and 
                listeners is losing touch with the traditional intonation of the 
                1920s and 30s largely because of the introduction of even-tempered 
                instruments and harmony in Arabic music.</font></p>
